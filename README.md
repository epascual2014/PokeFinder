# PokeFinder

This app was created to practice how to use the new Xcode 8 Beta and how to use the annotation views.
Want to thank Devslopes for giving the assets and teaching me the annotations.

This app is a single view controller that uses Firebase back end and GeoFire.

User can map out where they see certain pokemons
which let other users see it as well.

This is a continuing app.

TO DO:
Ability to choose what pokemon sighting from a pokedex dictionary.
Ability to tap on map.
Login and log out
